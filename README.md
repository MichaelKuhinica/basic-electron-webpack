# Electron Webpack Boilerplate

This repository provides the bare bones for Electron applications built with `webpack` and developed using `webpack-dev-server`.

## Getting started


```
yarn install
yarn dev

```

Open a different terminal tab

```

electron .

```

## TODO

- Separate `webpack` configuration for different environments
- Copy `index.html` from the root directory instead of reusing the one on `dist/`
